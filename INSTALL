======================
    INSTALLING OSAL
    A quick Guide
======================

I.  INTRODUCTION
    ============

    A.  Audience
        --------

        This document is written for people who intend to build OSAL from source
        code. OSAL may be distributed as a compiled library for a required
        target system. Normally, the only people who do this are OSAL
        maintainers/developers.

        If neither of these labels fits you, please contact the OSAL developers
        to get a pre-compiled OSAL version.

    B.  Dependency Overview
        -------------------

        You will need the following tools to build OSAL:

        * a reasonable C compiler. You'll need also a cross-compiler if you
          want to compile OSAL for embedded platforms.
        * make tools
        * Standard libraries

    C.  Dependencies in Detail
        ----------------------
        * The GNU assembler linker and binary utils, binutils v2.10
        * The GNU compiler, GCC v4.4.1.2-9
        * The GNU C cross-compiler, sparc-rtems-gcc GCC v3.3.2
        * The RTEMS real-time operating system v4.6.5
        * The GNU make utility, v3.81
        * The Qmake utility, v2.01a (Qt 4.3.2)
        * The shared libraries for terminal handling (ncurses)
            - libncurses5, v5.6
            - libncursesw5, v5.6
            - ncurses-base, v5.6
            - ncurses-bin, v5.6

        [TBD]


II. INSTALLATION
    ============

    A.  Building from a tarball
        -----------------------

        Download the mos recent distribution tarball from:

        http://to.be.defined

        Unpakc it, and use the standard GNU procedure to compile:

            $ tar xzvf osal.<version>.tar.gz
            $ cd osal.<version>
            $ make menuconfig
            $ make all install

        By default, the installation folder is /osal. In this folder you
        will find after installation:

            * include folder:   In this folder all the headers needed to work with
            OSAL will be placed
            * libosal folder:   In this folder the osal library compiled for the
            target platform will be placed.

        The default installation folder needs supervisor priviledges for
        installation. The installation folder may be specified defining the
        INSTALL_ROOR directory, for example:

            $ export INSTALL_ROOT=<installation_directory>

    B.  Working with OSAL
        -----------------
        
        Now you already may start developing with over OSAL. In the compilation
        chain you need to add some parameters to link with the osal library for
        the target platform, and also to specify the "include" folder in the
        compilation header path to use the OSAL header files.


        More information abou the OSAL API may be found in the Interface Control
        Document and in the Release notes distributed together with the OSAL package.
